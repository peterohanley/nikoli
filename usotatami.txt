Rules: Divide the diagram along the grid lines into rectangles which are exactly 1 cell width and any number of cells long. Each rectangle must contain exactly one cell with a number which is NOT identical to the length of the rectangle. The corners of 4 rectangles must not share a grid point.

my changes follow below
Rules: 
A	Divide the diagram along the grid lines into rectangles which are exactly 1 cell width and any number of cells long. 
B	Each rectangle must contain exactly one cell with a number which is NOT identical to the length of the rectangle. 
C	The corners of 4 rectangles must not share a grid point.
	

Square :: int -> int -> Square
either w or h = 1
Rect :: int -> int -> int -> int -> Rect
Rect x y w h
Solution :: [Rect]
Solution Rects

Constraint :: int -> Square -> Constraint
Constraint N Squares

Board :: int -> int -> [Constraint] -> Board
Board width height Constraints

do four rectangles share a corner?
phrase as "is there a 2x2 rectangle that overlaps all of them, while they are all disjoint"
