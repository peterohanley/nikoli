Rules: Divide the diagram along the grid lines into regions. Each region must contain exactly one circle and must be point symmetric on this circle.

My interpretation
Rules: 
A	Divide the diagram along the grid lines into regions. 
B	Each region must contain exactly one circle 
C	and must be point symmetric on this circle.

constraints (circles) can be in a square, on the line between two squares, or on the point between four squares.
Constraint X Y
for points on lines, use .5

regions must be circularly symmetric
regions must be connected
regions are sets of squares
Region Squares
symmetric(R = Region S, C = Constraint cx cy) =
	\forall Q = Square x y \in S .
	  \exists Square x' y' \in S
		where
		  dx = x - cx
		  x' = cx - dx
		  dy = y - cy
		  y' = cy - dy

connected(R = Region S) = 
	\/ \forall Q = Square x y \in S .
	  \/ \exists Square x+1 y \in S
	  \/ \exists Square x-1 y \in S
	  \/ \exists Square x y+1 \in S
	  \/ \exists Square x y-1 \in S
	\/ |S| = 1
